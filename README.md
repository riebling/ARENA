# ARENA
Render 3d content in AFrame from MQTT messages

## References
This code originated as a clone of the demo for a tool that exports a Unity scene as an A-Frame page https://github.com/if1live/unity-scene-web-exporter .
It was then modified to do real-time updating of scene objects based on another demo ("networked AFrame" https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe) and using MQTT in a browser https://github.com/reese-long/mqtt-browser-demo 

It now bears very little resemblance to the original, much commented out of `index.html`, and much added. The live ARENA site can be viewed at http://xr.andrew.cmu.edu on most devices. 

A sign-on screen at http://xr.andrew.cmu.edu/go lets you set your name, choose an environment theme, and set the 'scene' (associated with a 'topic') which can be thought of as a set of 3d objects. The default is 'render'. The settings are passed into the ARENA page as URL arguments such a `http://xr.andrew.cmu.edu?name=charles&theme=default&scene=render`

## Files
 * `mqtt.js` - Javascript to subscribe to MQTT topic(s) via wildcard, parse primitive-object messages, and add/remove AFrame Elements to the scene accordingly.
 The message format (as part of a higher level, more general "ARENA" system design plan for AR) is documented at work-in-progress  
https://conix.io/conix_mw/index.php?title=Spatial_Web/ARENA_Architecture#Pub.2FSub_Structure
 * `index.html` - mostly commented out AFrame HTML wrapper
 * `paho-mqtt.js` - a copy of (but not the location referenced in this code) the Eclipse Paho MQTT library, for convenient inspection
 * `cmds.sh` - linux commands to draw a small grid of test cylinders (to debug rotation)
 * `models/` - AFrame format model and material definitions for a space shuttle from the original demo scene
 * `CONIX.png` - a bitmap so we can draw the Conix logo on things (support for bitmaps on primitives is a TODO) that should really be in:
 * `images/` - a better place to store bitmaps :)
 * `shapes.py` - the most sandbox-like thing here: sample code to send random primitive shape draw commands as MQTT messages

 ## General Purpose AFrame using Subtopics
 Most of these take 10 comma separated digits which are x,y,z(location in meters),x,y,z,w(rotation in quaternions),x,y,z(scale factor where 1=100%)
#### Draw a Cube
 Instantiate, persist a cube and set all it's basic parameters
```
mosquitto_pub -r -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/cube_1 -m "cube_1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,#FFEEAA,on"
```
#### Color
change only the color of the already-drawn cube
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/cube_1/material/color -m '#00AA00'
```
#### Move
move the position of the already drawn cube
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/cube_1/position -m "x:1; y:2; z:3;"
```
#### Rotate
rotate the already drawn cube
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/cube_1/rotation -m "x:1; y:2; z:3;"
```
#### Animate
animate rotation of the already drawn cube
```
mosquitto_pub -r -t /topic/render/cube_1/animation -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -m "property: rotation; to: 0 360 0; loop: true; dur: 10000"
```
#### Remove
remove the cube
```
mosquitto_pub -r -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/cube_1 -m ""
```
#### Images
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/image_2 -m "image_2,0,2,-4,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,images/2.png,on"
```
Tiling images is a bit tricky; a still-not-fixed A-Frame bug rejects modifications to materials that have the same bitmap ("src") parameter as some kind of performance boost. But a message like this (after one like the previous) can set the tiling (repeat 4 times along X and Y axes), if you maybe play with the bitmap:
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/drone/image_2/material -m "src:images/2.png; repeat: 4 4" -r
```
Need to try URLs instead of `images/2.png` to see if we can point to a bitmap at an arbitrary URL.
#### Other Primitives: TorusKnot
Instantiate a wacky torusKnot, then turn it blue. (look for other primitive types in A-Frame docs)
```
mosquitto_pub -r -h oz -t /topic/render/torusKnot_1 -m "torusKnot_1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,#FFEEAA,on"
mosquitto_pub -h oz -t /topic/render/torusKnot_1/material/color -m '#0000FF'
```
#### Models
Instantiate a glTF v2.0 binary model (file extension .glb) from a URL. 
```
mosquitto_pub -r -h oz -t /topic/render/gltf-model_1 -m "gltf-model_1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,url(models/Duck.glb),on"
```
#### Relocalize Camera
Warp the camera with ID camera_5432 to a new coordinate (system). Values are x,y,z, (meters) x,y,z,w (quaternions)
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/camera_5432/rig -m "3,3,0,0,0,0,0"
```
#### Text
Add some text that says "Hello World"
```
mosquitto_pub -t /topic/render/text_3 -r -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -m "text_3,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,Hello World,on"
```
Change arbitrary text properties ( https://aframe.io/docs/0.9.0/components/text.html#properties ) for example, material.color:
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/text_1/material -m "color: blue"
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/text_1/material -m "color: #FF0000"
```
#### Lights
Persist a red light to the scene
```
mosquitto_pub -t /topic/render/light_3 -r -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -m "light_3,1,1,1,0.25,0.25,0,1,1,1,1,#FF0000,on"
```
Default is ambient light. To change type, or other light ( https://aframe.io/docs/0.9.0/components/light.html ) parameters, example: change to directional. Options: ambient, directional, hemisphere, point, spot
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/nick/light_1234/light -m "type: directional" -r
```
#### Sound
Play toy piano sound from a URL when you click a cube: first draw the cube
```
mosquitto_pub -t /topic/piano/box_3 -m "box_3,2,0,-4,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,#33AAEE,on" -r
```
then add sound with click event listener:
```
mosquitto_pub -t /topic/piano/box_3/sound -m "src:url(http://xr.andrew.cmu.edu/audio/toypiano/A1.wav); on: mousedown" -r
```
This lets only you hear the piano. To share the piano click events with others viewing the scene, add an event-listener Component:
```
mosquitto_pub -t /topic/piano/box_3/click_listener -m "" -r
```
#### Lines
Draw a purple line from (2,2,2) to (3,3,3); uses the first 6 parameters
```
mosquitto_pub -t /topic/render/line_1 -r -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -m "line_1,2,2,2,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,#CE00FF,on"
```
Extend the line with a new segment, colored green
```
mosquitto_pub -t /topic/render/line_1/line__2 -r -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -m "start: 3 3 3; end: 4 4 4; color: #00FF00"
```
#### Events
Add the "click-listener" event to a scene object; click-listener is a Component defined in `events.js`. This works for adding other, arbitrary Components. A non-empty message gets sent to the Component's `init:` function
```
mosquitto_pub -t /topic/render/cube_1/click-listener -m ""
```
#### Background themes
Adds one of many predefined backgrounds ( one of: [ none, default, contact, egypt, checkerboard, forest, goaland, yavapai, goldmine, threetowers, poison, arches, tron, japan, dream, volcano, starry, osiris]) to the scene
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/env/environment -m "preset: XXX"
```
#### Particles
This requires importing yet another javascript code blob, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-particle-system-component  
Done in two parts; first render the holder object for particles, then populate it
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/particle_1 -m "particle_1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,#FFEEAA,on"
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/particle_1/particle-system -m "preset: snow"
```

This is general; any AFrame supported parameters should be able to be used in the topic hierarchy. Most are single valued (position) some are double (material.color)  
The naming convention for a scene object identifier such as `line_1` is that the part before the underscore is the name of the A-Frame entity, and the part after the underscore is a unique identifier to differentiate from other entities (of the same type) in the scene.
It's up to us whether to make lower level topics for sub-parameters `/material/color` or `material.color`
Lastly, I'm not sure how this should work for retained PubSub messages: it would be possible that when subscribing to all topics of a scene, you will get multiple messages for an object: 1. Instantiation 2. Parameter A 3. Parameter B. and so forth, but not necessarily in the right order. Maybe we use smaller property-update message format for only 'realtime' or 'live' viewers, rather than persist each and every update. This helps address a possible problem with single-property-update topic 'spam': don't retain -> no spam.

## Commentary
Some hard-coded things:
 * MQTT broker running on `oz.andrew.cmu.edu` - runs with WebSockets enabled, because Paho MQTT needs to use WebSockets
 * MQTT topic structure is in flux. Used to be everything went to `/topic/render`, but this is definitely going to change. Each Object in the scene gets it's own topic, which is the 'name' of the object, e.g: `/topic/render/sphere_3` according to 
 * Naming convention: PrimitiveName_ID where Id is some unique identifier (integers for now), and PrimitiveName is something like 'sphere' 'cube' 'cylinder' etc.
 * MQTT draw messages set the 'Retain' flag such that new people visiting the page (example running at http://xr.andrew.cmu.edu/aframe) will see them. This is how to 'persist' things in the Scene. Otherwise set Retain to False or 'off' and the primitive gets drawn & seen only by those currently viewing the scene; a page re-load and they will disappear
 * Because of this, if you render a ton of retained things, there's a risk of spamming the scene. You might need to clean up by doing something like
  1. Get all the retained objects by subscribing to /topic/render/#
  2. Iterate through the ones you want to remove
  3. For each, issue a publish command to the object+topic, with retain set, and an empty message. This clears the topic. e.g:
```
mosquitto_pub -h oz.andrew.cmu.edu -t /topic/render/sphere_3 -m "" -r
```
